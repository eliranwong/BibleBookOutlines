# Outlines for Every Book in the Bible

In this GitHub repository, you'll find outlines for every book in the bible. These outlines were generated using ChatGPT-4 and a specific prompt created by [Eliran Wong](https://github.com/eliranwong). We created these outlines to help us develop [subheadings for the entire bible text](https://github.com/eliranwong/AmazingGraceBibleTranslationSeries/blob/main/subheadings/AGBsubheadings.py), which we plan to integrate into our [Amazing Grace Bible Translation Series](https://github.com/eliranwong/AmazingGraceBibleTranslationSeries).

# ChatGPT-4 Prompt

The ChatGPT-4 prompt is a pre-written sentence or phrase that is used to initiate a conversation with the ChatGPT-4 language model. This prompt is designed to stimulate the model's response, which is generated based on its pre-existing knowledge and understanding of natural language patterns.

In this project, we use the following prompt to generate the outlines:

> I am currently engaged in studying the book of {bible_book_name} in the Bible and would be grateful if you could assist me by providing a comprehensive outline of the book, covering all the chapters from 1 to {the_last_chapter_in_the_bible_book}. To aid my understanding, I would appreciate it if you could categorize the book into several main sections and further subdivide each section into different passages. For the sake of clarity, please break down each passage into its smallest possible units, as I am looking for a highly detailed outline that will enhance my comprehension of the text. Give me your own analysis based on the public domain ASV bible text instead of copying a published outline. Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide a title for each passage, without explanation.

# Our Undertakings

In addition to designing the prompt mentioned above, we generated two sets of outlines, compared them, and chose the best one for each bible book. Moreover, we created more comprehensive outlines for Genesis 1-11 and Genesis 12-50. Additionally, we generated subheadings for every single Psalm.

# Copyright

The outlines were created as a computer-generated work in the UK and are automatically protected by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The originality of this work is attributed to the specific prompt created by [Eliran Wong](https://github.com/eliranwong). For analysis, we directed ChatGPT to use the ASV text from the public domain, which is free of copyright. Under UK law, the author of computer-generated work is considered to be the person who made the necessary arrangements for its creation, which in this case is [Eliran Wong](https://github.com/eliranwong).
